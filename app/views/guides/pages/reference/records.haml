%h1 Records

%p Records are data structures that have a fixed set of keys.

%p
  You can define a
  %b record type
  with the
  %code record
  keyword:

%pre
  %code
    :escaped
      record User {
        email : String,
        name : String,
        id : Number
      }

%p.hint.hint--info
  = octicon "info"
  %span
    Records cannot have types which have type variables.

%h2 Literal

%p
  The easiest way to create a record is with a
  %b record literal:

%pre
  %code
    :escaped
      {
        email = "john@doe.com",
        name = "John Doe",
        id = 1
      }

%h2 Constructors

%p
  For each record a
  %b constructor function
  is available with the same name:

%pre
  %code
    :escaped
      record User {
        name : String,
        age : Number,
        active : Bool,
      }

      User("John Doe", 32, true) == {
        name = "John Doe",
        active = true,
        age = 32
      }

%p.hint.hint--info
  = octicon "info"
  %span
    The order of the parameters are in the same as the order the fields.

%p
  This function can be partially applied as well:

%pre
  %code
    :escaped
      record User {
        name : String,
        age : Number,
        active : Bool,
      }

      try {
        partial =
          User("John Doe", 32)

        partial(true) == {
          name = "John Doe",
          active = true,
          age = 32
        }
      }

%h2 Nested records

%p
  Records can be nested in each other, using
  %b nested type definitions.

%pre
  %code
    :escaped
      record Position {
        x : Number,
        y : Number
      }

      record Entity {
        position : Position,
        id : String
      }

%p
  Creating a nested record is straightforward:

%pre
  %code
    :escaped
      entity =
        {
          position = {
            x = 0,
            y = 0
          },
          id = "0"
        }

%h2 Working with records

%p Records can be created like this:

%pre
  %code
    :escaped
      {
        email = "john.doe@gmail.com",
        name = "John Doe",
        id = 0
      }

%p
  You can create a new record by copying from an existing one and changing only
  some of the fields, like this:

%pre
  %code
    :escaped
      user =
        {
          email = "john.doe@gmail.com",
          name = "John Doe",
          id = 0
        }

      updatedUser =
        { user | name = "Stuart" }

      {
        email = "john.doe@gmail.com",
        name = "Stuart",
        id = 0
      }

%p.hint.hint--warning
  = octicon "alert"
  %span
    Trying to set fields to a record which doesn't have it in its definition
    will raise an error.
